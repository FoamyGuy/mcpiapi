#Minecraft Pi API mod

This is a [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Universal) mod that reimplements (a subset of) the Minecraft Pi edition API.

The Minecraft Pi Edition exposes a [simple to use API](](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft.html.) This plugin recreates this API within your desktop Minecraft, so you can have have fun programming Minecraft on your Desktop the same way you program your Pi edition as well.

Not all the commands are implemented, and I've probably botched up the right way to do many things -- this was my first foray into writing a forge plugin. But I hope you find it useful and fun nevertheless.

Functionally, this mod is similar to the [RaspberryJuice plugin](https://github.com/zhuowei/RaspberryJuice) so you may want to look at it as well. Rasperry juice runs on a Bukkit server, whereas this mod runs under any client running Minecraft Forge.
